Git Hub Initialization:

>>> $ mkdir GitHub  				#Create a new directory. A place to store your code locally. I called mine "GitHub"

>>> $ mkdir cd GitHub				#Change into the newly created directory. Remember this is how we initialize code in general. 

>>> $ git init						#Creates .git file that is used to compile code into .git format, 
									#so that it's ready for upload to a Git Repository.

>>> $ ls -a 						#Checks to see which hidden files have been created in the new directory. 

>>> $ git remote add origin "URL"	#Syncs local machine to the repository address, URL. 
									#This also adds the file "origin" which creates another link

>>> $ git add *						#Push a file, folder, or "*" everything in the selected 
									#directory to the staging area (still on your local).

>>> $ git commit					#Pushes a file to then be committed. It also recursive, see the following line:

	>>> $ git commit - m			#Commits with a tag, name, etc.

>>> $ git push -u origin			#Pushes, rather uploads, the staging area files and 
									#directories to the online repository selected branch (e.g. "Master Branch")

>>> $ git pull						#pulls online content to your corresponding .git directory on your local

# Now you are ready to start using git with your code.
