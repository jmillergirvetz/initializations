Git Hub Initialization:

>>> $ mkdir GitHub  				#Create a new directory. A place to store your code locally. I called mine "GitHub"

>>> $ cd GitHub			#Change into the newly created directory. Remember this is how we are able to initialize code in general.

>>> $ git init			#Creates .git file that is used to compile code into .git format,
							#so that it's ready for upload to a Git Repository.

>>> $ ls -a 			#Checks to see which hidden files have been created in the new directory.

>>> $ git remote add origin <URL>	#Syncs local machine to the repository address, URL.
						#This also adds the file "origin" which creates another link

>>> $ git add *			#Push a file, folder, or "*" everything in the selected
						#directory to the staging area (still on your local).

>>> $ git commit		#Pushes a file to then be committed. It also recursive, see the following line:

>>> $ git commit - m  <###>		#Commits the update with a tag, name, etc. Replace # with your update name.

>>> $ git push -u origin			#Pushes, rather uploads, the staging area files and
							#directories to the online repository selected branch (e.g. "Master Branch")

>>> $ git pull					#pulls online content to your corresponding .git directory on your local

			# Now you are ready to start using git with your code.
